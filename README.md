# ML_Final_Project

Traffic Signs Recognision project.

The purpose of the project is to create a module that will be able to release traffic signs.

Project launch process: 

1. Start myCode the file.(NOTE: In advance, we suggest changing in line 21 epoch = 10 to epoch = 1. The reason is a long code run. But if you change, then the accurancy graph will not work, so you have not changed it to 1. In the report, you can check that the graph actually works. We suggest you not to take your time)
2. Start test_code file.
3. After running test_code file, the camera opens
4. Show any traffic sign on camera, for example a "STOP" sign
5. Interupt the project by pressing the stop button.

At the top of the camera you will see the name of the sign and the probability of matching.
